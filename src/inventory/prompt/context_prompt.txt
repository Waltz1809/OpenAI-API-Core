To accommodate the entire human population, pocket dimensions are created around Japan to house the returned populace. In order to find a way to return to outer space, the humans begin reenacting human history according to the Holy Book Testament. But in the year 1413 of the Testament Era, due to the destruction of the land created above Japan for the reenactment which was called the Divine Realm, the nations of the pocket dimensions split Japan's territory into several "Divine States" most of which are ruled over by Japanese noble families of which the "Far East" of Japan is represented and the flying ship Musashi is the location of the Far East's academy. Musashi circles Japan and periodically docks in Far East Divine State territory. It is now the year 1648 of the Testament Era, and the Divine States are monitored by the Testament Union, the authority that runs the re-enactment of history.

General terms

Testament

A history book that records the history of the former earth. To ensure mankind's eventual return to space, the original History is recreated by reenacting its main events in the chronological order with selected individuals reprising the role of historical figures of said events. For some reason the recreation of History is halted in 1648 with the last event predicted to be reenacted being the Peace of Westphalia. There are rumors that this occurs because the apocalypse is set to happen after these particular events. In these events, the Far East currently play a neutral role as by that time in the original History, Japan was under the Shogunate of Tokugawa, isolated from the rest of world, thus having little to no participation at all in events occurring overseas.

Harmonic Divine States

Administrative divisions ruled by different countries in the Testament era. The Harmonic Divine States are the Far East (ruled by Japan), Tres España (Spain and Portugal), K.P.A. Italia (Italy), Hexagone Française (France), England, Qing-Takeda (China), Sviet Rus (Russia), P.A. ODA (Ottoman Empire), M.H.R.R. (Holy Roman Empire), United States of India and the Africa Union. Several areas were left undeveloped by purpose to be occupied in the future as the recreation of History continues, like the New Continent (Americas).

Maus

A miniature contractor god that can enhance the user's fighting capabilities.

Divine Transmission (通神, Tsūshin)

The way of wireless communication in this era. It's a pun with the word 通信 (Tsūshin), which means communication.

Haiki (拝気)

The energy used to use abilities in the series.

Ether (流体, Ryūtai)

The basic substance that gives form to all existence. Mankind at that point is advanced enough to harness the Ether itself and use it as energy source and to construct materials directly from it. It is believed that the impending apocalypse is to be caused by a strange phenomena that recently appeared that consumes all Ether it comes in contact with and upon taking heed of it, the Harmonic Divine States start working together to keep it from spreading, to the point of sharing all research they make about it.

Armaments

Armaments (武装, Busō) are technology used in this era.

God of War

A God of War (武神, Bushin) is a gigantic mechanized unit controlled by either the pilot (as data through disintegration) or through remote. Mass-produced or custom-built, these units can replicate human reaction times in real-time, therefore making it the most superior among all mechanized units. The Gods of War are classified based on their overall weight (i.e. light, medium, and heavy).

Weapons

Divine Armaments

Divine Armaments (神格武装, Shinkaku Busō) are the general weapons with abilities. They have 2 activations: Normal Activation (通常駆動, Tsūjō Kudō) and Superior Activation (上位駆動, Jōi Kudō). They have an ether limit which needs to be filled when empty, and thus prevents the user from constantly using high level activations.

Mortal Sin Armaments (大罪武装, Taizai Busō), known as Logismoi Óplo (Greek: Λογισμοι όπλο; Japanese: ロイズモイ・オプロ, Roizumoi Opuro) are weapons of destructive power, powered by the power of sins. They are made using Horizon's emotions, thus stripping most of Horizon's personality by the completion, with only the feeling of envy left. They have Normal Activation like Divine Armaments, but instead of Superior Activation they have Overdrive Activation (超過駆動, Chōka Kudō). In addition, all Mortal Sin Armaments have another activation called Soul Activation (魂の駆動, Tamashii no Kudō), which is only limited for Horizon to use. However, to use Soul Activation, she will need Tori's ability. Reclaiming all of them is Musashi's goal of the series. As of volume 4C of the novel, Horizon has 3 in possession, with the exception of Olos Phtonos. The user of any Mortal Sin Armaments are referred as Eight Great Dragon Kings (八大竜王, Hachidai Ryūō), with the exception of Horizon.
